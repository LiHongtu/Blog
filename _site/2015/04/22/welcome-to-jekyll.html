<p>You’ll find this post in your _posts directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run jekyll serve, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>To add new posts, simply add a file in the _posts directory that follows the convention YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>def print_hi(name)</p>

  <p>puts “Hi, #{name}”</p>

  <p>end</p>

  <p>print_hi(‘Tom’)</p>

  <h1 id="prints-hi-tom-to-stdout">=&gt; prints ‘Hi, Tom’ to STDOUT.</h1>
